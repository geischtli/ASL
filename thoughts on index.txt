querried columns

On MESSAGE

RECEIVER
RECEIVER		|	QUEUE
SENDER		|	RECEIVER
RECEIVER		|	QUEUE

we use only 1 index on message working on receiver and queue
this allows also single column querries for receiver to use this index
and the only other critical querry for sender and receiver can profit
also from it by reusing the receiver index, but i hope it pays of to not use
another index because in the doc it says that they have to be used with caution,
so we rather play a safe game here
